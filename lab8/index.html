    <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
			The challenges that I faced with this lab was not being able to get the
			output to appear on the site. I was having trouble knowing where to start
			and if I was going in the right direction. I looked over the sides from
			class and asked mypartner for help but still had trouble.

      </p>
    <h2> Results </h2>
      <p>
				The result is that I have a website that has Javascript that does not
				work. The HTML and CSS are working, it is just the JavaScript that Iâ€™m
				having trouble with.
