    <h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>

    <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
				I did not have a big challenge with this lab. It just took me a second
				 to understand how to start, which is usually my biggest problem.
				 However I figured it out with help from my parten, the lector slides
				 and W3schools.
      </p>
    <h2> Results </h2>
      <p>
				The results of this lab is that I created a button in JavaScript that
				has an action occur when pressed.
      </p>
		<h2> What will happen when you press the button?</h2>
