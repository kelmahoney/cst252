    <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
					Some challenges that I had with this lab was Javascript. I could get
					 to apparel but I could not get it to work. It was very overwhelming
					  and a lot of information out there but still I could not get it to
						 work. Howevery I did fix it and how it works!
      </p>
    <h2> Results </h2>
      <p>
				The result is that I have a website with a button that does work.
      </p>

				<input type="text" id="user-name">
				<button id="my-button">click me </button>
				<div id= "output">
