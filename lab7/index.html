    <h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>

    <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p>
			The challenges that I faced when I came to this lab was the script output
			not appearing. I took a step back and asked my partner for help, which
			really helped.
      </p>
    <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p>
				The problem that occurred during this lab was the output was not
				appearing. The problem was in the HTML where the Javascript was linked.
				I had it as js/lab7.js, when my file name was just lab. So I just had to
				talk out the 7 to make it work.
      </p>
    <h2> Results </h2>
      <p>
				The result of this lab is a name randomiser, that when you type your
				name it reorders the letters.
