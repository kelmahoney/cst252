				<p>I am a transfer student from West Valley Community College in Saratoga, CA.
				My major is Communication Design with a concentration in Visual Design.
				The fields that interest me are packaging design and web development.
				I enjoy organizing and making sure everything has its own space which is what has drawn me to packing design.
				I was born and raised in Sunnyvale California with my three older sisters. In my free time I like to bake, right now I'm working on perfecting my maple scone recipe.
				My ideal job is to combine my two passions: baking and packing design.</p>

				<p>I am a Communication Design Major with a concentration in game design and I have a minor in Cinematic Arts and Technology.
				I wanted to concentrate in game design because I loved the process of creating the game more specifically in sound design.
				This aspiration led me to also minor in cinematic arts because the process for both game and cinema are very similar and I knew that I can also reach a bigger audience this way.
				I would also like to become a professor for arts or design.</p>
