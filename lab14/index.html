    <h2> Challenge </h2>
			<p> There was not really a big challenge with this lab. I just needed more
					time on it because I had a lot of homework during this week.
					</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p> There were no problems. However I did use W3schools for the css for
					the columns.
					</P>
    <h2> Results </h2>
